            Hello, and welcome my name is Makayla Cambiano, and I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri, studying library science.
            I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in World History, where I specialized in classics and antiquity.I graduated with honors in the Spring of 2023 from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. 
            My focus now is research. I plan to complete my graduate degree by 2025, where I hope to work as a research librarian or archivist.
         
            I love to research and consider myself a lifelong learner with a passion for the pursuit of knowledge.<br>

            I have worked in Museums and libraries, and now I continue my education as I travel the world trying to quench my thirst for knowledge.
            In high school, I had a deep passion for studio art and art history.
            I have had my work displayed in Jefferson City, Missouri in the State Capital building and I continue to make art commissions often.
            History is a huge part of my life and I hope to share some knowledge with this page.
           
            <strong>Thank you!</strong>
