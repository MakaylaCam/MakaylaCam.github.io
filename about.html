        <h3>Hello my name is Makayla Cambiano!</h3>
        <h4>Welcome to history</h4>
         
        <blockquote>"Human history in essence is the history of ideas."><strong>-H.G. Wells</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Hello, and welcome my name is Makayla Cambiano, and I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri, studying <em>library science.</em>
            I have a B.A.in World History, where I specialized in classics and antiquity.
            I graduated with honors in the <em>Spring</em> of 2023 from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.</p>

           <p>I love to research and consider myself a lifelong learner with a passion for the pursuit of knowledge.
            I have worked in Museums and libraries, and now I continue my education as I travel the world trying to quench my thirst for knowledge.
            In high school, I had a deep passion for studio art and art history. I have had my work displayed in Jefferson City, Missouri in the State Capital building and I continue to make art commissions often.
            History is a huge part of my life and I hope to share some knowledge with this page. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
